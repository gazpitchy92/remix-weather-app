# Remix Weather App

Welcome to the Remix Weather App, built using Remix.js and MaterialUI.

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## To-Do

1. Use Remix cookie storage.
2. Move calls to weather API into a backend Express.js API proxy.
3. Add full OAuth process.

## Known Problems

1. Hard refreshing the `/HomePage` causes the CSS to break.
